## The Problem
Although I am pretty decently fast at typing with 6 fingers, it requires me to move my hands a lot. There are a couple problems with this. First it is bad ergonomics. My hand begins to hurt after long coding sessions. Second, it is not very accurate. When typing with only six fingers I have to move my hand arround a lot which leaves more room for error when reaching for far keys. This is especially true for symbol keys which is a problem since I am a programmer. I also started using nvim recently to improve my workflow so being efficient and pressing keys accurately is important to me.

####### *Note: I started practicing ten finger typing on Jul 2nd and my pinkies where so shaky. I wanted to be semi consistent before I started recording speeds.
I will be doing three typracer races after a 30 minute practice session, and then average those three scores to get my daily average.*
