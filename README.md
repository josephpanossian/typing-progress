# typing-progress
------
Note: I started practicing ten finger typing on Jul 2nd and my pinkies where so shaky. I wanted to be semi consistent before I started recording speeds.
I will be doing three typracer races after a 30 minute practice session, and then average those three scores to get my daily average.
